## üìù Description
This is a single-page text-editor application that meets the PWA crietia. Additionally, it features a number of data presistence techniques that serve as redudancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser and can also function offline. Using an existing application, I demonstrate my ability to implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. 

You can find the application [here](https://peaceful-hamlet-70308.herokuapp.com/)
